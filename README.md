# School-breaker:
Spams files, takes up RAM, slows down computers.
This tool does not require any PIP installations.
All you need is python.
# Examples of use:
• School computers.
• Siblings devices.
# Features:
• Console spammer.
• File spammer.
• New window spammer.

Aswell as all of the above but threaded.
# Note:
I know this is bad, and I do not care. It does what I need it to do.
Please post issues when you find them, and if you decide to skid this, please consider giving credits.
